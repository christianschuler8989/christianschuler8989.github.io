**This is my new home on the web! Here I can play around and show you a bit about the academic side of my life :D**

This site is obviously very much still work-in-progress, but you can already read a bit in some of the sections regarding my [publications](/publications.html), previous [teaching](/teaching.html), some selected [projects](/projects.html), and attended [events](/events.html). <!--, and finally my [CV](/cv/). -->

Please feel free to contact me any time with your questions, or maybe just to chat about some cool ideas!
